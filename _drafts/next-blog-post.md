## Wedding at Cana

### Brought to you by the letter W

* Weddings
* Wine
* Wanderings in the Wilderness (Exodus)

##### Jesus is the one to fix the party

The miracle show us a lot about Jesus. About who he was. 

Take the wine, the master of the banquet, head steward, and save him from embarrassment. 

Why is this the first miracle? Making a party continue a bit longer? What is it about this miracle that we are supposed to be paying attention to? Jesus is showing that the rejoicing and praying and positivity is coming. 

Isaiah 25:8

> in that day the Lord of Hosts, will make for his people a feast. 

Death will be swallowed up. No more shame or struggling. 

We are to hear:

> Of all the thing I can show you to begin my ministry, my calling card, the first blip on your radars that the Son of God is here and he is going to work in your world and change it all around, it is the water into wine. 

Because we are out of wine. 

We are trying to get things going, we would dearly love to be in an eden-like world that has enough for everyone and there is no envy and distrust and destruction and systematic problems baked into everything we build. 

We canâ€™t even be happy in ourselves on our own, and when we get big groups together they fight amongst themselves, or if they get along for a bit they end up fighting against another group. 

#### Our weddings cannot keep going on. We are running out of juice.
