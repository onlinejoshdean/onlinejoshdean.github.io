## Maomi and Rith - Unbroken

Consider the book of Ruth

- Set in the time of the Judges
- Starts in Israel, moves to Moab, then returns to Israel
-Follows three people living faithfully in difficult times

One of them is an outsider, but all are faithful

- God blesses all of them
- Ends with a short genealogy explaining that the people involved are King David’s ancestors

Three things to learn

1. Ruth helps us when God is not clearly present

2. Ruth helps us be empowered to do what God wants of us

3. Ruth leads us to the great David - she shows us the end of the cycles of violence 


This formed the introduction of a sermon I gave earlier this year.

## Famine 

Famine is the circumstance that caused an Israelite family to migrate to Moab. Famine was a recurring event in patriarchal times, causing Jacob and his sons to migrate to Egypt. Enslaved and oppressed, they experienced God’s deliverance, an event remembered annually at Passover (Ex. 12:1–29). In the book of Ruth the same God and godly people came to the aid of two needy women, demonstrating his and their power to bring good out of sorrow, life out of death.

The author of Ruth could see part of God’s purpose for human history being fulfilled in David; the Christian reader can fit the part into the whole, for God was executing a plan to redeem humankind through great David’s greater son. 

The author of Ruth was also aware of God’s hand upon the personal circumstances of families and individuals, encouraging them to look back over events and to trace the mysterious outworking of God’s overflowing goodness in their lives.

In personal life and in history God was working out the good purpose, even when God is not nearby, heard out loud, or felt by the people concerned.
